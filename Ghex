When we try to open the png image the image doesn't open.I put the image in hex editor to find if all components were in place which wasn't actually. So i corrected the critical chunks.Magic number,Png to PNG,IDATA,IHDR THE file opened which was a screenshot from matlab with a large line  in between ..-. .-.. .- --. --. .... . -..- ..-. .-. .- -.-. - .. --- -. .- - . -.. -- --- .-. ... . . -. -.-. --- -.. . .-. .When i decoded it in morse code editor i found it out to be FLAGGHEXFRACTIONATEDMORSEENCODER which is flag{GHEXFRACTIONATEDMORSEENCODER}
